            <span  class="e5_29">Vanilla compatibility</span><span  class="e5_30">PlugData is directly based on pd-vanilla, with minimal modifications to the original source code. This ensures very high compatibility between pure-data patches and PlugData patches.</span><span  class="e5_8">Many, many objects</span><span  class="e5_15">Export patches to audio plugins, embedded platforms or raw code</span><span  class="e5_9">PlugData comes with the ELSE and cyclone libraries installed by default. 
            ELSE is a large set of general-purpose objects that offer more high-level abstraction on top of pure-data. Cyclone is included to make Max users feel at home when they first try PlugData.  </span><span  class="e5_17">PlugData is a free/open-source visual programming environment based on pure-data. It is available for a wide range of operating systems, and can be used as a standalone app, or as a VST3, LV2 or AU plugin.</span><span  class="e5_16">PlugData integrates with the Heavy/hvcc project to allow patches to be converted into C/C++ code. It ships with a compiler toolchain to make exporting plugins, or building patches for embedded platform a piece of cake.</span>
